## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

Before creating bug reports, please check issues list as you might find out that you don't need to create one.
 When you are creating a bug report, please include as many details as possible.
 
 > **Note:** If you find a **Closed** issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open
  a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.
